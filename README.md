CommandTimer
========

A plugin that makes command warmups, cooldowns, and restrictions easy.

## Why CommandTimer?

I have used boosCooldowns in the past, but it's become a huge pain to maintain.
The alias support isn't the best, and you have to write the command multiple times for
it to be recognized. For example, `/tp` requires you to also block `/tp *`. The difficulty
of managing this becomes a lot greater with all of the aliases of `/tp` (you need to add
those in manually) and it's even more if you want give different timers to multiple groups.

CommandTimer is a much easier alternative to maintain.
